The CCSP certification is structured around six interconnected domains that form the Common Body of Knowledge (CBK) for cloud security, each representing a crucial aspect of expertise in the field.
These domains and their respective weightings on the exam are: Cloud Concepts, Architecture and Design (17%), Cloud Data Security (20%), Cloud Platform & Infrastructure Security (17%), Cloud Application Security (17%), Cloud Security Operations (16%), and Legal, Risk and Compliance (13%).
The exam itself consists of 125 multiple-choice questions and must be completed within a 3-hour time limit.
It is administered exclusively at Pearson VUE Testing Centers.
The certification requires candidates to have five years of cumulative IT experience, with at least three years in information security and one year in one or more of the six CCSP domains.
