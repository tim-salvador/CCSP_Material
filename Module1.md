# üìñ CCSP Module 1 Study Sheet: Cybersecurity Basics  

---

## 1. CCSP Overview
- ISC¬≤ + Cloud Security Alliance developed CCSP.  
- **6 Domains**:  
  1. Cloud architecture & design  
  2. Cloud data security  
  3. Cloud platform & infrastructure security  
  4. Cloud application security  
  5. Cloud operations & management  
  6. Cloud legal, risk & compliance  

**Exam Tip**: Even if the cloud provider handles infrastructure, **GRC is always customer‚Äôs responsibility**.

## 2. CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality**: Only authorized access (encryption, least privilege).  
- **Integrity**: Prevent unauthorized modification (hashes, digital signatures).  
- **Availability**: Ensure access when needed (backups, RAID, clustering).  

**Opposites = DAD**: Disclosure, Alteration, Destruction.  

---

## 3. Governance Principles
- **Policy**: Management intent (strategic).  
- **Standards**: Rules & consistency.  
- **Procedures**: Step-by-step actions.  
- **Guidelines/Baselines**: Supporting docs.  

**Policy Types**:  
- Regulatory (HIPAA, SOX, PCI DSS).  
- Advisory (acceptable use, PII/PHI handling).  
- Informative (awareness, company goals).  

---

## 4. Control Frameworks
Frameworks = structured methods to apply controls. Must be **consistent, measurable, standardized, comprehensive, modular**.  

**Examples**:  
- NIST 800-53 ‚Üí 385+ controls, 19 families.  
- ISO 27001/27002 ‚Üí International, 114 controls in 14 groups.  
- CIS Controls ‚Üí 20 prioritized controls.  
- COBIT ‚Üí IT governance.  
- PCI DSS ‚Üí Payment card.  
- COSO ‚Üí Financial reporting/internal control.  
- CMMI ‚Üí Process improvement (Levels 1‚Äì5).  

**Analogy**: Wolf = threat, Hole in fence = vulnerability, Sheep = asset.  

---

## 5. NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- Origin: **Obama EO 13636 (2013)** ‚Üí voluntary.  
- **Trump EO 13800 (2017)** ‚Üí mandatory for federal agencies.  

**Components**:  
1. **Core**: Functions (IPDRR ‚Üí Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) ‚Üí Categories ‚Üí Subcategories ‚Üí References.  
2. **Tiers**: 1 = Partial, 2 = Risk-informed, 3 = Repeatable, 4 = Adaptive.  
3. **Profiles**: Current vs. Target ‚Üí roadmap, gap analysis.  

**Mnemonic**: ‚ÄúI Play Defense, Ready & Resilient.‚Äù  

---

## 6. Regulatory Compliance
- **International Law**: Conventions, customs, principles.  
- **U.S. Law Types**: Criminal (gov prosecution), Civil/Tort (private lawsuits).  
- **Intellectual Property**: Copyright, Patents, Trademarks, Trade Secrets.  
- **Privacy Laws**: GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, GLBA, OECD, FISMA, PCI DSS.  

**Key Concepts**:  
- **Due Care** = Doing the right thing (e.g., deploy antivirus).  
- **Due Diligence** = Checking it‚Äôs maintained (e.g., update patches).  
- **Negligence** = Failure of either ‚Üí liability.  
- **Senior Management = Always responsible.**  

---

## 7. Quiz Review (Sample Exam Points)
- **SOC Trust Principles**: Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, Privacy.  
- **CIA Triad Pillars**: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.  
- **NIST CSF Functions**: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.  
- **Vendor lock-in**: Customer can‚Äôt migrate/leave CSP.  
- **Private Cloud**: Best for high security/privacy orgs.  
- **External Governance**: Vendors, contractors, suppliers, customers.
