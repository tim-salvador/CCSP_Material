## 4. Data Security in the Cloud
### Data Protection Methods
- **Encryption**: Protects data at rest, in use, and in transit.
  - **Data at Rest**: Storage-based (e.g., file-level, transparent, application-level encryption).
  - **Data in Use**: Client/endpoint-based DLP.
  - **Data in Transit**: Network-based/gateway DLP (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP).
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**:
  - **Components**: Data discovery/classification, monitoring, enforcement.
  - **Challenges**: Data replication/movement, performance impact.
- **Alternatives to Encryption**:
  - **Masking/Obfuscation**: Hides sensitive data (e.g., random substitution, algorithmic substitution, shuffle, masking, deletion).
  - **Anonymization**: Removes indirect identifiers to prevent data aggregation.
  - **Tokenization**: Substitutes sensitive data with non-sensitive tokens.

### Key Management
