## 1. Cloud Computing Concepts
- **NIST 5 Characteristics**: On-demand self-service, Broad network access, Resource pooling, Rapid elasticity, Measured service.  
- **Cloud Service Models**:  
  - **IaaS** ‚Üí Infrastructure as a Service (VMs, networking, storage).  
  - **PaaS** ‚Üí Platform as a Service (runtime, databases, dev tools).  
  - **SaaS** ‚Üí Software as a Service (apps for end-users).  
- **Key Benefits**: Agility, scalability, cost savings, pay-per-use.  

**Mnemonic:** ‚Äú**OBRRM**‚Äù = On-demand, Broad, Resource pooling, Rapid elasticity, Measured.

## 2. Cloud Reference Architecture
- Defined in **NIST SP 500-292**.  
- **Actors:**  
  - Cloud Service Consumer (CSC)  
  - Cloud Service Provider (CSP)  
  - Cloud Broker  
  - Cloud Carrier  
  - Cloud Auditor  
- Establishes standardized terminology and roles for secure cloud ecosystems.  

**Exam Tip:** Know the 5 actors ‚Äî often tested in scenario questions.

## 3. Cloud Service Deployment Models
- **Public Cloud** ‚Üí Shared infrastructure, multi-tenant, cost-effective.  
- **Private Cloud** ‚Üí Dedicated infrastructure, higher control/security.  
- **Hybrid Cloud** ‚Üí Mix of private + public, flexible but complex.  
- **Community Cloud** ‚Üí Shared among organizations with common goals (e.g., healthcare, government).  

**Design Tradeoffs:** Cost vs. security vs. compliance.  

---

## 4. Security Aspects of Virtualization
- **Hypervisor types:**  
  - Type 1 = Bare-metal (e.g., VMware ESXi, Hyper-V).  
  - Type 2 = Hosted (e.g., VirtualBox).  
- **Risks:** VM escape, VM sprawl, snapshot exposure, hypervisor compromise.  
- **Mitigations:** Hardening hypervisor, patching, limiting admin access, strong network segmentation.  

---

## 5. Principles of Secure Cloud Computing
- **Defense in Depth** ‚Üí multiple layers of security.  
- **Least Privilege** ‚Üí minimum required rights.  
- **Separation of Duties** ‚Üí split critical tasks.  
- **Data-Centric Security** ‚Üí protect data at rest, in motion, and in use.  
- **Redundancy & Availability** ‚Üí failover, clustering, geo-redundancy.  
- **Secure APIs** ‚Üí reduce attack surface, enforce authentication.  

---

## 6. Design Requirements
- **Business Requirements ‚Üí Security Requirements ‚Üí Cloud Design.**  
- **Data classification** drives encryption and access control (public, internal, confidential, restricted).  
- **Regulatory requirements** must be mapped to cloud controls (HIPAA, PCI DSS, GDPR).  
- **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)** should define uptime, RTO/RPO, penalties.  

**Exam Tip:** Always tie requirements back to **business objectives + compliance needs**.  

---

## 7. Cloud Model Boundaries
- **Shared Responsibility Model:**  
  - CSP ‚Üí Security *of* the cloud.  
  - CSC ‚Üí Security *in* the cloud.  
- **Isolation boundaries:** logical separation (VMs, containers, tenant networks).  
- **Data location & jurisdiction** ‚Üí compliance concerns (GDPR, data sovereignty).  

---

## 8. Protecting Sensitive Information
- **Encryption:** At rest, in transit, in use.  
- **Key Management:** CSP vs. customer-owned keys (KMS, HSM).  
- **Tokenization/Masking:** Replace sensitive data with surrogates.  
- **DLP (Data Loss Prevention):** Prevent exfiltration of sensitive data.  
- **Identity & Access Management:** MFA, RBAC, JIT access.  

---

## 9. Threat Modeling
- **STRIDE model:** Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege.  
- **DREAD scoring:** Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability.  
- **Cloud-specific threats:**  
  - Insecure APIs  
  - Insider threats  
  - Multi-tenancy risks  
  - Data breaches  
  - Misconfigured storage (e.g., S3 buckets)  

**Mitigation:** Perform continuous threat modeling, pen testing, red/blue teaming.
