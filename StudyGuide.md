# CCSP Study Guide

The Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP) certification, offered by ISC2, validates expertise in cloud security architecture, design, operations, and compliance. This study guide is based on the official CCSP exam outline effective since August 1, 2022 (with minor updates in November 2023). As of September 9, 2025, the exam is currently in a 3-hour linear format with 125 multiple-choice questions, requiring a passing score of 700/1000. Starting October 1, 2025, it will transition to a variable-length Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) format with 100-150 questions.

The exam covers six domains. This guide breaks down each domain with its weight, subtopics, and key study notes, including explanations, concepts, and tips. For preparation, use official ISC2 resources, the CCSP CBK, practice exams, and related certifications like CCSK. Study tips: Focus on understanding concepts, not memorization; practice with real-world cloud scenarios (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP); join study groups; allocate time based on domain weights.
